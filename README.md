Dataset:

- each data sample is a 1D signal containing 2400 points

 

Expected Results:

- What is the method used for the clustering? How is it decided which method to use?

- Visualization of the clusters with the labels of the data point

- The developed codes

Hint: You may need to focus on a part of the signal for the best clustering
